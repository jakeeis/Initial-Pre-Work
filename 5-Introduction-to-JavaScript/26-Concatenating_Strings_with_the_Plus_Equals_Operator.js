//In this exercise I learned to concatinate strings with the += operator which
//concatinates the previous value with the new value

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
