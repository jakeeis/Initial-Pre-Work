//In this exercise I learned how to add a variable to a string with the += operator.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "fun.";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
